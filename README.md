# Network-Lab-Final-Project-Group-7

## Description
This is a multi client, multi device, and multi server group chat application, where you can chat with another people, be an admin where you can kick another member, sending files, transfering your admin title to another member, and last but not least play "Rock, Paper, Scissor" game online another person. What makes our application different from the inspired code is that we have managed to combine the chatting feature and another application wich is a game so that the client can have fun when they chatting.

## Instruction:
To run this application we should run it on the terminal/shell like this "python server.py (IP) (Port)".
In order to run the app correctly, we have to run it in this order:
1. server.py
2. client.py

Please enjoy the application!
Thank you
