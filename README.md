# Network-Lab-Final-Project-Group-7

## Description
This is a multi client, multi device, and multi server group chat application, where you can chat with other people, be an admin where you can kick other members, send files, transfer your admin title to another member, and last but not least play "Rock, Paper, Scissor" online with another user. What makes our application different from the inspired code is that we have managed to combine the chatting feature and the game so that the client can have fun while they chat.

## Instructions:
To run this application we should run it on the terminal/shell using the format: python <server.py OR client.py> <IP address> <port number>
 
In order to run our program correctly, we have to run it in this order:
1. server.py
2. client.py

Please enjoy the application!
Thank you
